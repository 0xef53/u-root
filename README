#This is a root file system all based on Go.

#The only binary is the builder, and 6?. The rest gets
#built dynamically into a ramdisk-mounted /.
#
#You can test with chroot.
#
#Then set (assuming you are in $HOME):
export GOPATH=$HOME/u-root
export GOROOT=$HOME/u-root/go
PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOPATH/buildbin:$GOPATH/go/bin:$PATH
#
(GOBIN=`pwd`/buildbin go install installcommand)
#
mkdir -p bin
sudo mount -t tmpfs none go/pkg/linux_amd64
sudo mount -t tmpfs none bin
#
bash
#
#then type 
#date
#and watch how it goes.
#
#What happens: 
#finds date in $HOME/u-root/buildbin/date
#symlink to installcommand
#runs installcommand, installs date in $HOME/u-root/bin, 
#installcommand runs the command with arg.
#
#All subsequent invocations of date run the compiled version.
