This is a proof of concept. 
I tried this one year ago, got it sort of working, then
ran out of time. 
getgo will copy what's needed from $1/go
Would be better if if it read */*.go and only got those packages.

Should not copy unused binaries. Only needs go, ?g, ?l, pack.
Does not need binary packages. 

Then set (assuming you are in /root):
GOBIN=/root/u-root/bin/
GOROOT=/root/u-root/go/
PATH=$GOBIN:/root/u-root/buildbin:$PATH

cd  installcommand
GOBIN=../buildbin go install

mount -t tmpfs none bin

PATH=`pwd`/bin:`pwd`/building:$PATH

then type 
date
and watch how it goes.

What happens: 
finds date in /root/u-root/buildbin/date
symlink to installcommand
runs installcommand, installs date in /root/u-root/bin, 
installcommand runs the command with arg.

All subsequent invocations of date run the compiled version.
